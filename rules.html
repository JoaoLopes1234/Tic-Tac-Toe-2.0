                <p class="explain">The main board consists of 9 mini games, arranged in a 3x3 grid.
                    Each mini game is a standard 3x3 tic-tac-toe board, referred to as a "mini game board".</p>

                    On your turn, you play in a square of a mini game.
                    The square you play in determines which mini game your opponent will play in next.
                    For example, if you play in the center square of your mini game, your opponent must play in the
                    central mini game on the main board.

                    Each mini game follows tic-tac-toe rules. Winning a mini game secures it for that player.
                    The goal is to win three mini games in a row on the main board (horizontally, vertically, or
                    diagonally).
